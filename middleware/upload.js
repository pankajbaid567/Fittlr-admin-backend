 * Filters uploaded files based on their MIME type.

 * This middleware function checks if the uploaded file is an image by examining its MIME type.
 * If the file is an image (i.e., its MIME type starts with "image/"), the callback is invoked with 
 * `true`, allowing the file to be uploaded. Otherwise, the callback is invoked with an error, 
 * preventing the upload and returning a "Only image files are allowed!" error message.
 * 
 * @param {Object} req - The Express request object.
 * @param {Object} file - The file object representing the uploaded file.
 * @param {Function} cb - The callback function to be called after the file is filtered.
 * @param {string} file.mimetype - The MIME type of the uploaded file.
 * 
 * @callback cb
 * @param {Error|null} error - An error object if the file is not an image, or `null` if it is.
 * @param {boolean} acceptFile - A boolean indicating whether the file should be accepted (`true`) or rejected (`false`).
